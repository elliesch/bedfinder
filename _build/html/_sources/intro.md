# Random forest applications for glacial geomorphology

This book is structured to walk readers of all levels through a use-case example
of applying a random forest model to positive relief feature data, with the end 
goal of forecasting which datapoints are glacially-derived streamlined bedforms. 

Check out the content pages for specific background and application information.
