# Random forest applications for glacial geomorphology

This book is structured to walk readers of all levels through a use-case example
of applying an optimized Random Forest and XGBoost model to positive relief feature data, with the end 
goal of forecasting which input polygons mapped across a landscape are glacially-derived streamlined bedforms. 

Check out the content pages for specific background and application information.
All questions on usage, additional applications, and training set data can be directed to [Marion McKenzie](marion.mckenzie@mines.edu) or
