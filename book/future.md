# Summary and future work in machine learning for glacial geomorphology

Trained machine learning models, such as the one developed here, can only be improved through inclusion of additional data. Expanding the range of trained datasets improves the applications of the model to new data by including a greater variation of data that may be encountered and statistically comparable to trained data structures. 

Therefore, incorporation of developed geomorphology datasets, in this particular case, datasets of [streamlined subglacial bedforms](bedforms.md), are paramount to the future of machine learning in the field of glacial geomorphology. Many datasets have been developed and are publically available, but many are not. This data inaccessibility and inconsistent metadata standards highlight a need for collaboration across the field to share results and data. 

Collaborators interested in developing TPI and random forest methods for other use-cases or in working to expand, share, and document training datasets for machine learning, please contact [Marion McKenzie](marion.mckenzie@mines.edu).
