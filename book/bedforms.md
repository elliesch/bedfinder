Streamlined subglacial bedforms, such as mega-scale glacial lineations, drumlins, whalebacks, and ribbed bedforms, are created by the movement of ice over a sediment substrate, resulting in formations aligned parallel to the ice flow direction (Clark, 1993; Hermanowski et al., 2019). The presence and characteristics of these bedforms are indicative of past ice stream activity and can reveal information about basal flow directions, ice flow velocities, and the influence of subglacial geology on ice dynamics (Cofaigh et al., 2002; Kamleitner, 2023; Aradóttir et al., 2022; Evans et al., 2004; Greenwood and Clark, 2010; McKenzie et al., 2022; McKenzie et al., 2023). These features can be erosional or depositional in nature and occur across a continuum of length-width morphometrics (Ely et al., 2016). Along with other glacial geomorphic features in the geologic record, streamlined subglacial bedforms can be used to interpret entire ice sheet histories from bedform assemblages, build understanding of processes that control bedform formation and evolution, contribute to identifying glaciation style, identify areas of interest for field campaigns, and provide constraints to ice sheet modeling (Chandler et al., 2018). 

Elongate features created in parallel to the direction of ice flow serve as valuable indicators of past ice behavior, providing a means to reconstruct ice flow patterns, basal conditions, and the influence of subglacial geology on ice dynamics. These bedforms offer a glimpse into the history of ice sheets and their responses to changing environmental conditions.

## Utility in automated mapping landscapes

Previous methods in mapping streamlined subglacial bedforms has been conducted manually (e.g., Principato et al., 2016; Norris et al., 2017) using Fourier spectra data (Spagnolo et al., 2017), through object-oriented automatic identification e.g., (Saha et al., 2011), contour-tree mapping (Wang et al., 2017), and by identifying slope variations in the landscape at various scales (e.g., McKenzie et al., 2022; Sookhan et al., 2021; Eyles et al., 2022). Each of these mapping techniques has associated error, where the most inconsistent error arguably stems from  manual identification. Subjectivity in streamlined subglacial bedform identification can contribute to uncertainty that varies depending on the individual conducting mapping. Whereas automated or semi-automated techniques of streamlined subglacial bedform mapping also have error associated with feature identification and filtering, reproducible methods contribute to consistent and predictable error. Despite large advances in mapping deglaciated landscapes and using these data to interpret paleo-ice flow behavior, the use of machine-learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in landscape mapping to identify streamlined subglacial bedforms has been limited.

Automating mapping efforts for the field of glacial geomorphology with the use of ML is a natural next step to further progress and efficiency within the field of glacial geomorphology. The use of a quantifiable and reproducible classification model enables the comparison of large datasets across vast spatial scales while maintaining a statistically robust comparison. ML approaches in glacial geomorphology can enable us to further elucidate controlling factors of subglacial conditions on basal regimes and ice streaming, both by providing further confirmations of existing hypotheses and by reducing the amount of time and effort necessary to calculate secondary data products. By using much of the mapping that has been manually verified and made publicly available (e.g., Clark et al., 2018; Norris et al., 2017; Greenwood et al., 2021; Streuff et al., 2022; McKenzie et al., 2022; McKenzie et al., 2023), ML tools will be greatly improved and increase accessibility of mapping efforts to the broader scientific community.
